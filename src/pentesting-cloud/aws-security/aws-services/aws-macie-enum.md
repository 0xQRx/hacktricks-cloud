# Amazon Macie

## Introduction

Amazon Macie is a data security service that discovers sensitive data by using machine learning and pattern matching, provides visibility into data security risks, and enables automated protection against those risks.

## Listing Findings with AWS Console

After scanning a specific S3 bucket for secrets and sensitive data, findings will be generated and displayed in the console. Authorized users with sufficient permissions can view and list these findings for each job.

## Revealing Secret

Amazon Macie provides a feature that displays detected secrets in clear-text format. This functionality aids in the identification of the compromised data. However, displaying secrets in clear-text is generally not considered best practice due to security concerns, as it could potentially expose sensitive information.

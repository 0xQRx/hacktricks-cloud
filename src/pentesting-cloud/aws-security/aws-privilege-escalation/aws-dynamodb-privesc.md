### Post Exploitation

As far as I know there is **no direct way to escalate privileges in AWS just by having some AWS `dynamodb` permissions**. You can **read sensitive** information from the tables (which could contain AWS credentials) and **write information on the tables** (which could trigger other vulnerabilities, like lambda code injections...) but all these options are already considered in the **DynamoDB Post Exploitation page**:

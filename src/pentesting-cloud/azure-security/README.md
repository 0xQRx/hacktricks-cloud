## Azure Pentester/Red Team Methodology

In order to audit an AZURE environment it's very important to know: which **services are being used**, what is **being exposed**, who has **access** to what, and how are internal Azure services and **external services** connected.

From a Red Team point of view, the **first step to compromise an Azure environment** is to manage to obtain some **foothold**.

### Initial Access

Here you can find the most common ways to get initial access to an Azure/Entra ID environment:

- **OSINT**: Check for **leaks** in Github or any other open source platform that could contain **credentials** or interesting information.
  - 
- **Social** Engineering
- **Password** reuse, leaks or [password spraying](az-unauthenticated-enum-and-initial-entry/az-password-spraying.md)
- Vulnerabilities in Azure-Hosted Applications
  - [**Server Side Request Forgery**](https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/pentesting-web/ssrf-server-side-request-forgery/cloud-ssrf.html) with access to metadata endpoint
  - **Local File Read**
    - `/home/USERNAME/.azure`
    - `C:\Users\USERNAME\.azure`
    - The file **`accessTokens.json`** in `az cli` before 2.30 - Jan2022 - stored **access tokens in clear text**
    - The file **`azureProfile.json`** contains **info** about logged user.
    - **`az logout`** removes the token.
    - Older versions of **`Az PowerShell`** stored **access tokens** in **clear** text in **`TokenCache.dat`**. It also stores **ServicePrincipalSecret** in **clear**-text in **`AzureRmContext.json`**. The cmdlet **`Save-AzContext`** can be used to **store** **tokens**.\
      Use `Disconnect-AzAccount` to remove them.
- 3rd parties **breached**
- **Internal** Employee
- [**Common Phishing**](https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/generic-methodologies-and-resources/phishing-methodology/index.html) (credentials or Oauth App)
  - [Device Code Authentication Phishing](az-unauthenticated-enum-and-initial-entry/az-device-code-authentication-phishing.md)

Even if you **haven't compromised any user** inside the Azure tenant you are attacking, you can **gather some information** from it:

{{#endref}}

> [!NOTE]
> After you have managed to obtain credentials, you need to know **to who do those creds belong**, and **what they have access to**, so you need to perform some basic enumeration:

## Basic Enumeration

> [!NOTE]
> Remember that the **noisiest** part of the enumeration is the **login**, not the enumeration itself.

### SSRF

If you found a SSRF in a server inside Azure check this page for tricks:

### Azure & Entra ID tooling

The following tools will be super useful to enumerate both Entra ID tenants and Azure environments slowly (to avoid detection) or automatically (to save time):

### Bypass Login Conditions

<figure><img src="../../images/image (268).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In cases where you have some valid credentials but you cannot login, these are some common protections that could be in place:

- **IP whitelisting** -- You need to compromise a valid IP
- **Geo restrictions** -- Find where the user lives or where are the offices of the company and get a IP from the same city (or contry at least)
- **Browser** -- Maybe only a browser from certain OS (Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iOS) is allowed. Find out which OS the victim/company uses.
- You can also try to **compromise Service Principal credentials** as they usually are less limited and its login is less reviewed

After bypassing it, you might be able to get back to your initial setup and you will still have access.



### Whoami

> [!CAUTION]
> Learn **how to install** az cli, AzureAD and Az PowerShell in the [**Az - Entra ID**](az-services/az-azuread.md) section.

One of the first things you need to know is **who you are** (in which environment you are):

{{#tabs }}
{{#tab name="az cli" }}

```bash
az account list
az account tenant list # Current tenant info
az account subscription list # Current subscription info
az ad signed-in-user show # Current signed-in user
az ad signed-in-user list-owned-objects # Get owned objects by current user
az account management-group list #Not allowed by default
```

{{#endtab }}

{{#tab name="AzureAD" }}

```bash
#Get the current session state
Get-AzureADCurrentSessionInfo
#Get details of the current tenant
Get-AzureADTenantDetail
```

{{#endtab }}

{{#tab name="Az PowerShell" }}

```bash
# Get the information about the current context (Account, Tenant, Subscription etc.)
Get-AzContext
# List all available contexts
Get-AzContext -ListAvailable
# Enumerate subscriptions accessible by the current user
Get-AzSubscription
#Get Resource group
Get-AzResourceGroup
# Enumerate all resources visible to the current user
Get-AzResource
# Enumerate all Azure RBAC role assignments
Get-AzRoleAssignment # For all users
Get-AzRoleAssignment -SignInName test@corp.onmicrosoft.com # For current user
```

{{#endtab }}
{{#endtabs }}

> [!CAUTION]
> Oone of the most important commands to enumerate Azure is **`Get-AzResource`** from Az PowerShell as it lets you **know the resources your current user has visibility over**.
>
> You can get the same info in the **web console** going to [https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseAll](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseAll) or searching for "All resources"

### Entra ID Enumeration

By default, any user should have **enough permissions to enumerate** things such as users, groups, roles, service principals... (check [default AzureAD permissions](az-basic-information/index.html#default-user-permissions)).\
You can find here a guide:

{{#ref}}
az-services/az-azuread.md
{{#endref}}

> [!NOTE]
> Now that you **have some information about your credentials** (and if you are a red team hopefully you **haven't been detected**). It's time to figure out which services are being used in the environment.\
> In the following section you can check some ways to **enumerate some common services.**

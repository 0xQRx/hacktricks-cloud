# Az - Permissions for a Pentest

{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

To start a white box hardening review of some Entra ID tenats you need to ask for **Global Reader role on each tenant**. Moreover, to perform a hardening review of different Azure subscriptions you would need at least the **Reader permissions over all the subscriptions**.

Note that if those roles aren't enough to access all the info you need, you could also ask the client for roles with the permissions you need. Just try to **minimize the amount of not read-only permissions you ask for!**

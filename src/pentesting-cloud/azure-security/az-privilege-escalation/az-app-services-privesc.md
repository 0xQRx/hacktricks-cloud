### Microsoft.Web/sites/publish/Action, Microsoft.Web/sites/basicPublishingCredentialsPolicies/read, Microsoft.Web/sites/config/read, Microsoft.Web/sites/read,&#x20;

These permissions allows to call the following commands to get a **SSH shell** inside a web app

- Direct option:

```bash
# Direct option
az webapp ssh --name <name> --resource-group <res-group>
```

- Create tunnel and then connect to SSH:

```bash
az webapp create-remote-connection --name <name> --resource-group <res-group>

## If successfull you will get a message such as:
#Verifying if app is running....
#App is running. Trying to establish tunnel connection...
#Opening tunnel on port: 39895
#SSH is available { username: root, password: Docker! }

## So from that machine ssh into that port (you might need generate a new ssh session to the jump host)
ssh root@127.0.0.1 -p 39895
```
